# Dogs vs Cats Classification

## Objective
The objective of this project is to classify images of dogs and cats using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Data
- **Source**: The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/chetankv/dogs-cats-images).
- **Description**: The dataset contains images of dogs and cats for binary classification.
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Downloaded and extracted images.
  - Created training and validation sets.

## Methods
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized sample images from the dataset.
- **Model Building**:
  - Built and trained a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras.
  - The architecture included multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, and fully connected layers at the end.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated the model using accuracy and loss metrics.

## Results
The CNN model achieved an accuracy of X% on the validation set.
