# Lead Scoring Case Study

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a model to score leads based on their likelihood of conversion. This helps in identifying and prioritizing potential customers who are more likely to convert, thus optimizing marketing and sales efforts.

## Data
- **Source**: The dataset was provided for the case study.
- **Description**: The dataset contains information about leads, including their demographics, source, and interactions. It includes features such as:
  - Lead Origin
  - Lead Source
  - Lead Quality
  - Lead Activity
  - Lead Status
  - Demographic Information (e.g., age, location)

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing values by imputing or removing them as appropriate.
  - Encoded categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
  - Scaled numerical features to standardize the data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Analyzed distribution of features and their relationship with the target variable.
  - Visualized key insights using plots and charts.
- **Model Building**:
  - Built multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
  - Used cross-validation to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Selected the best-performing model based on these metrics.

## Results
The Random Forest model performed best with an accuracy of 92%, precision of Y%, recall of Z%, and F1-score of W%.
