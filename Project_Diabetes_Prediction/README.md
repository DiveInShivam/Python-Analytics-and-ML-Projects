# Diabetes Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health parameters.

## Data
- **Source**: The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).
- **Description**: The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, indicating whether the patient has diabetes.

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, scaled features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzed distribution of features, correlation with target.
- **Model Building**: Used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The KNN model performed best with an accuracy of 73%.
